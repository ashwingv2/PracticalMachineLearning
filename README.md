# PracticalMachineLearning
Final Project for Practical Machine Learning in Coursera

Loading the data
Initially, I loaded training and test data

Cleaning the data
The data needed to be cleaned in order to apply various machine learning algorithms on it.
Initially, I looked at all the columns where there were a lot of NA values in them and removed them from the data set. 
There were also some columns which consisted of a lot of blank values, which I removed as well.
Finally, I removed the timestamp variables from the set.
Additionally, the 'new_window' variables had unequal distribution of yes/no values, so I removed both new_window and num_window from the dataset. 

I divided this data into a training set and a validation set. I plan on building models

Modeling the data
I various algorithms to the model and determined that
